/*
 * JCC wrapper for sys/cdefs.h
 * 
 * This stub includes Availability.h first (to set up JCC compatibility macros)
 * then includes the real sys/cdefs.h from the system include path.
 * 
 * The order matters because sys/cdefs.h uses __GNUC__ and __has_attribute
 * to define macros that JCC cannot parse (like __attribute__((__always_inline__))).
 * By including Availability.h first, we ensure __has_attribute returns 0
 * and __attribute__ is stripped.
