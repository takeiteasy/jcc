> **WARNING**: This is a work in progress and shouldn't be used for any serious work

`JCC` is a **J**IT **C**11 **C**ompiler. The preprocessor/lexer/parser is built from [chibicc](http://https://github.com/rui314/chibicc) and the VM was built from [c4](https://github.com/rswier/c4) and [write-a-C-interpreter](https://github.com/lotabout/write-a-C-interpreter).

## About

The goal of this project is correctness and safety. This is just a toy, and won't be 🚀🔥 **BLAZING FAST** 🔥🚀. I wouldn't recommend using this for anything important or in any production code. I'm not an expert, so safety features may not be perfect and will have *minimal* to **significant** performance overhead (depending on which features are enabled).

**Status**: All C11 language features are supported (minus `<threads.h>` and `_Thread_local`, see [Thread Support](#thread-support)). There is also partial C23 support (mostly parser/preprocessor features).

See [here](https://takeiteasy.github.io/jcc) for some basic documentation on the API.

## Features

- GDB-like debugger (see [DEBUGGER.md](./DEBUGGER.md))
  - Export source maps as JSON `cc_output_source_map_json`
- Tonnes of memory safety features (see [SAFETY.md](./SAFETY.md))
  - Includes preset safety levels, `-0, -1, -2, 3` (0 is no safety, and is default)
  - Safety features come with an overhead
- Bytecode optimization passes (see [OPTIMIZATION.md](./OPTIMIZATION.md))
  - `--optimize[=LEVEL]` with levels 0-3 (disabled by default)
  - Constant folding, peephole optimization, dead code elimination
- Optional libcurl integration, include headers from URL
  - `#include <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/user/repo/main/header.h>`
  - Build with `make JCC_HAS_CURL=1`
- Output JSON files containing all function, struct, union, enums, and globals definitions
  - Useful for generating wrapper for FFI
  - `./jcc --json -o lib.json lib.h`
- Built in memory allocation using `--vm-heap` (enabled by some safety features)
  - All `malloc/calloc/realloc/free` calls are routed through an internal allocator
  - No need to use standard library for heap allocations


## Core C Language Support

### Operators

- Arithmetic: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`, unary `-`
- Bitwise: `&`, `|`, `^`, `~`, `<<`, `>>`
- Comparison: `==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`
- Logical: `&&`, `||`, `!`
- Assignment: `=`, `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, `%=`, `&=`, `|=`, `^=`, `<<=`, `>>=`
- Increment/decrement: `++`, `--` (both prefix and postfix)
- Ternary: `? :`
- Comma: `,`

### Control Flow

- `if`, `else`
- `for`, `while`, `do-while`
- `switch`, `case`, `default`
- `goto label`, `goto *expr;`, `&&label`
- `break`, `continue`

### Functions

- Function declarations and definitions
- Function calls (direct and indirect via function pointers)
- Recursion
- Parameters and return values
- Function pointers (declaration, assignment, indirect calls)
- Variadic functions (`<stdarg.h>` support with `va_start`, `va_arg`, `va_end`)

### Data Types

- Basic types: `void`, `char`, `short`, `int`, `long`, `float`, `double`, `_Bool`
- Pointers (declaration, dereference `*`, address-of `&`, pointer arithmetic)
- Arrays (fixed-size, initialization, multidimensional, indexing)
- Array decay (in function parameters and expressions)
- Zero-length arrays (`int arr[0];` GNU extension for flexible array members)
- Strings (literals with data segment storage)
- Structs (declaration, member access `.`, nested structs, initialization, flexible array members, anonymous structs/unions)
- Bitfields (bit-level struct member access with `: width` syntax, signed/unsigned, read-modify-write operations)
- Unions (declaration, member access, initialization, anonymous unions)
- Enums (declaration, explicit values, in expressions and switches)
- Variable-length arrays (VLA with runtime allocation via VM heap)

### Storage Classes & Qualifiers

- `static` (static locals, static globals, static functions)
- `extern` (external linkage for multi-file projects)
- `const` (const-correctness in type system and codegen)
- `inline` (parsed and generated normally, behaves like static, no special optimization)
- `volatile` (tracked in type system, prevents optimization of accesses)
- `register` (accepted and ***ignored***, no special optimization)
- `restrict` (accepted and ***ignored***, aliasing not tracked)

### Other Features

- `typedef` (all types including function pointers)
- `sizeof` operator (compile-time evaluation for all types)
- Forward declarations (incomplete types, self-referential structs)
- Floating-point arithmetic (double precision with full operations)
- Compound literals (scalars, arrays, structs)
- Designated initializers (arrays and structs)
- Cast expressions (explicit type conversions)

### Preprocessor

- `#include` (with intelligent search path handling)
  - **Standard library headers** (`<stdio.h>`, `<stdlib.h>`, etc.) automatically use JCC's `./include` directory
  - **User headers** with `"quotes"` search `-I` paths
  - **Non-standard angle-bracket headers** require `--isystem` paths (system headers not searched by default)
  - Full paths work directly
  - No `-I./include` flag needed - added automatically
- `#define` (object-like and function-like macros)
- `#ifdef`, `#ifndef`, `#if`, `#elif`, `#else`, `#endif`
- `#elifdef`, `#elifndef`
- `#undef`
- `#pragma once`
- `#error`, `#warning`
- Macro expansion and stringification
- `__VA_OPT__` for conditional variadic macro expansion (C23)
- `#embed` - Binary resource inclusion (C23)
  - Embeds binary files as comma-separated integer literals (0-255)
  - `#embed "file.bin"` - Quoted form (searches include paths)
  - `#embed <file.bin>` - Angle bracket form (searches system paths)
  - `limit(N)` parameter - Restricts number of bytes embedded
  - `__has_embed("file")` - Check file availability (returns 0=not found, 1=non-empty, 2=empty)
  - Files >10MB trigger warnings by default (50MB for secondary warning)
  - `--embed-limit=SIZE` - Customize warning threshold (e.g., `--embed-limit=100MB`)
  - `--embed-hard-limit` - Make limit violations hard errors instead of warnings
  - `prefix(...)`, `suffix(...)` - Pre/append parameters to data
  - `if_empty(...)` - Handle empty resources
- String literal concatenation (adjacent strings automatically combined)

### Linker

- Multiple input files
- Symbol resolution
- Duplicate definition detection

### Foreign Function Interface (FFI)

JCC provides two modes for variadic foreign functions:

- **Native Inline Assembly**
  - **AAPCS64** (macOS ARM64)
  - TODO: x86_64 (System V AMD64)
  - TODO: x86_64 (Windows x64)
  - TODO: x86_32 (Legacy 32-bit System V)
- **Optional libffi support** (Other platforms)
  - Build with `make JCC_HAS_FFI=1` to enable libffi support (see [BUILD](#build))
  - Use libffi if your platform isn't supported

### Inline Assembly

- `asm("...")` statements via callback mechanism
- Not executed in the VM (no-op by default)
- Callback can emit custom bytecode or perform logging

### C11 Features

- Universal character names `\uXXXX`, `\UXXXXXXXX` - Unicode escapes in strings
- `_Generic` type-generic expressions (compile-time type selection)
- `_Alignof` operator (query type/variable alignment)
- `_Alignas` specifier (control variable alignment)
- `static_assert` and `_Static_assert` (compile-time assertions with custom error messages)
- `Bitfields` - Bit-level struct member access (e.g., `unsigned int flags : 3;`)
- `Anonymous structs/unions` - Direct member access without intermediate name
- Variable length arrays `int arr[] = { 1, 2, 3 };`

### C23 Features

- `typeof` operator (compile-time type inquiry for variables and expressions)
- `typeof_unqual` - typeof that removes type qualifiers
- `[[...]]` - C23 attributes, like GNU attributes, are parsed but ***ignored***
- Binary literals (0b10101010)
- Digit separators with single quotes (1'000'000)
- `#embed` directive (C23) - Binary resource inclusion

### GNU Extensions

- Statement expressions `({...})`
- `__attribute__((...))` for functions and variables (currently ***ignored***, parsed only)
- Labels as values `&&label` - Get the address of a label for computed goto
- Computed goto `goto *expr;` - Jump to an address computed at runtime
- Switch case ranges `case 1 ... 5:` - Match ranges of values in switch statements
- Zero-length arrays `int arr[0];` - Flexible array member alternative
- Nested functions - Define functions inside other functions with access to parent variables

### Thread Support

> Not supported (yet)

JCC is single-threaded and does not implement any threading or atomic operations yet. Registering `pthread` as a dynamic library amd loading the functions may work but is untested.

## Standard Library Support

JCC has a custom standard library that is located in `include`. It is just a collection of headers with function declarations that are registered with the VM when they are included. This is so that you can easily include the standard library without having to register each function manually and also define a lot of preprocessor macros. If JCC ever becomes mature enough to include the proper system headers, this will be replaced.


## TODO

- Blocks/closures (`^{}`) - Complex feature requiring variable capture and closure runtime
- Preprocessor support for `__has_include`, `__has_include_next`, `__has_extension`, `__has_feature`
- Support for `_Defer` statement
- Support for `_Pragma` statement
- Support for (some) C23 `[[...]]` and GNU `__attribute__((...))` attributes
- Proper inlining support
- Support more architectures for native FFI
  - x86_64 (System V + Windows) + x86_64 (legacy System V only)
  - No plans for any other systems, but will accept patches
- Support for pthread + internal thread support
  - Thread safety features (race condition checks, etc)

## Building

```bash
make jcc        # Build jcc compiler
make all        # Build everything (jcc, libjcc.dylib) and run tests

# Optional: Build with libffi support for true variadic foreign functions
make JCC_HAS_FFI=1

# Optional: Build with libcurl support for URL header imports
make JCC_HAS_CURL=1
```

This produces:
- `jcc` - Full compiler executable (C source → bytecode → execute)
- `libjcc.dylib` - Shared library for embedding

### Compile to Bytecode

```bash
# Compile C source to bytecode file
./jcc -o program.bin program.c

# With multiple files
./jcc -o app.bin main.c utils.c helpers.c

# With preprocessor flags
./jcc -I./include -DDEBUG -o debug.bin main.c
```

### Running Tests

All test files are located in the `tests/` directory. To run the complete test suite:

```bash
./run_tests
```

This will run all test files and report:
- Total number of tests
- Number of passed tests
- Number of failed tests
- List of any failed tests

**Test runner options:**

```bash
# Run only tests matching a pattern
./run_tests --match "*embed*"     # Runs test_embed_basic.c, test_embed_empty.c, etc.
./run_tests --match "test_ptr*"   # Runs test_ptr_arithmetic.c, test_ptr_deref.c, etc.

# Enable memory leak detection (platform-specific: leaks on macOS, valgrind on Linux, drmemory on Windows)
./run_tests --leaks

# Pass additional flags to jcc (all non-option arguments are forwarded)
./run_tests -2                    # Run tests with standard safety level
./run_tests --vm-heap             # Run tests with VM heap enabled
```

Individual tests can be run directly:

```bash
./jcc tests/test_simple.c
echo $status  # Check exit code, should be 42
```
